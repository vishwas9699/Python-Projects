**Scenario**

#Your task is to prepare a simple code able to evaluate the end time of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.

#For example, if an event starts at 12:17 and lasts 59 minutes, it will end at 13:16.

#Don't worry about any imperfections in your code - it's okay if it accepts an invalid time - the most important thing is that the code produce valid results for valid input data.

#Test your code carefully. Hint: using the % operator may be the key to success.
