**Scenario**

#The continue statement is used to skip the current block and move ahead to the next iteration, without executing the statements inside the loop.

#It can be used with both the while and for loops.

*Your task here is very special: you must design a vowel eater! Write a program that uses:*

#a for loop;

#the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)

#the continue statement.

#Your program must:

*ask the user to enter a word;

*use userWord = userWord.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about the so-called string methods and the upper() method very soon - don't worry;

*use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;

*print the uneaten letters to the screen, each one of them on a separate line.
