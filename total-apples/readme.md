**Scenario**

Here is a short story:

Once upon a time in Appleland, John had three apples, Mary had five apples, and Adam had six apples. They were all very happy and lived for a long time. End of story.

Your task is to:

#create the variables: john, mary, and adam;

#assign values to the variables. The values must be equal to the numbers of fruit possessed by John, Mary, and Adam respectively;

#having stored the numbers in the variables, print the variables on one line, and separate each of them with a comma;

#now create a new variable named totalApples equal to addition of the three former variables.

#print the value stored in totalApples to the console;

#experiment with your code: create new variables, assign different values to them, and perform various arithmetic operations on them (e.g., +, -, *, /, //, etc.). Try to print a string and an integer together on one line, e.g., "Total number of apples:" and totalApples.
