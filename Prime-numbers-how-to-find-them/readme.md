# **Scenario**

A natural number is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Complicated? Not at all. For example, 8 isn't a prime number, as you can divide it by 2 and 4 (we can't use divisors equal to 1 and 8, as the definition prohibits this).

On the other hand, 7 is a prime number, as we can't find any legal divisors for it.


Your task is to write a function checking whether a number is prime or not.

The function:

*is called isPrime;

*takes one argument (the value to check)

*returns True if the argument is a prime number, and False otherwise.

Hint: try to divide the argument by all subsequent values (starting from 2) and check the remainder - if it's zero, your number cannot be a prime; think carefully about when you should stop the process.

If you need to know the square root of any value, you can utilize the ** operator. Remember: the square root of x is the same as x^0.5.
