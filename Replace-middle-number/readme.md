# **Scenario**

There once was a hat. The hat contained no rabbit, but a list of five numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Your task is to:

#write a line of code that prompts the user to replace the middle number in the list with an integer number entered by the user (step 1)

#write a line of code that removes the last element from the list (step 2)

#write a line of code that prints the length of the existing list (step 3.)
